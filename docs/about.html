      <h1>What is this?</h1>

      <p>Data on political leaders from all over the world.</p>

      <h1>Why?</h1>

      <p>Because the main source that people otherwise use for this is the <a
      href="https://www.cia.gov/resources/world-leaders/">CIA World Leaders
      Directory</a>, and we think the world deserves something better than
      that.</p>

      <h1>How are you better than them?</h1>

      <p>Well, one big way is that they don’t seem to have updated their lists
      since 2020. But even if they were up to date, their data is very basic:
      just a plain list of names of who holds what position. We provide some
      extra biographical information where possible (gender, data of birth,
      etc), but—more importantly—also make sure that everyone is linked to a
      <a href="https://www.wikidata.org/">Wikidata</a> item, where usually
      much more information is available.


      <h1>But the CIA list covers more places than you.</h1>

      <p>They’ve been at it a lot longer, and have a <b>lot</b> more resources.
      But we’re expanding quickly, and will hopefully catch up to them soon
      enough. To get there, though, we could really use your help.<p>

      <h1 id="Help">How can I help?</h1>

      <p>If you see something that’s wrong, the best thing to do is to
      correct it yourself. Every officeholder here has a direct link to their
      Wikidata item, and, just like with Wikipedia, that’s open for anyone
      to edit. Your changes won’t be updated on Peppercat instantly: that
      happens as part of a regular process where we check that updates look
      correct, but they should appear soon. (If they don't, then get in touch.)</p>

      <p>If fixing something yourself seems a bit too scary or difficult, or it
      all goes horribly wrong somewhere, just let us know by twitter or email,
      and we’ll look into it ourselves.</p>

      <p>If you think we’ve left out an important position somewhere, let us
      know, and we’ll look into adding it. We frequently laugh at the CIA
      managing to leave the Prime Minister and Foreign Secretary out of its <a
      href="https://www.cia.gov/resources/government/united-kingdom/">UK
      list</a>, but we’ve probably done something just as silly somewhere.</p>

      <p>If you want to help us add a new place, the most useful thing
      you can find for us is a link to an official website where the list of
      Ministers gets maintained and updated — i.e. it always lists the
      <i>current</i> Ministers, not just those who were appointed at a
      particular time. That enables us to automatically check every night for
      changes, to help make sure our list is always as up to date as possible.</p>

      <h1 id="Licensing">How can I use this data?</h1>

      <p>At the bottom of each page of data, there’s a CSV file of everything
      you can see on the page. We hope it should be fairly self-explanatory,
      but if it’s not, then get in touch. (NB: We haven’t completely worked out
      yet exactly what should be there, so you should beware that the columns
      might change in later versions.)</p>

      <h1>Who are you?</h1>

      <p>This was put together by <a href="https://twitter.com/tmtm">Tony
      Bowden</a>, with a lot of assistance from <a
      href="https://twitter.com/payo">Paul Youlten</a> and <a
      href="https://twitter.com/pudo">Friedrich Lindenberg</a>, and designs
      from <a href="https://twitter.com/wearewhy">Why</a>. But it also builds
      on the work of many, many others, particularly everyone who has
      contributed political information to Wikidata, or has worked on all the
      wonderful Free Software this relies so heavily on. A lot of heavy lifting
      is made <b>much</b> simpler thanks to
      <a href="https://github.com/maxlath/wikibase-cli">wikibase-cli</a>,
      <a href="https://stedolan.github.io/jq/">jq</a>, and
      <a href="https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv">qsv</a> (<i>née</i>
      <a href="https://github.com/BurntSushi/xsv">xsv</a>).
      </p>

      <p>We'd also like to hear more about who <i>you</i> are, how you’re using the
      data, or what would need to be added to make it possible for you to use.</p>
