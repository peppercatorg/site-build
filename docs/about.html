      <h1>What is this?</h1>

      <p>Data on political leaders from all over the world.</p>

      <h1>Why?</h1>

      <p>Because the main source that people otherwise use for this is the <a
      href="https://www.cia.gov/resources/world-leaders/">CIA World Leaders
      Directory</a>, and we think the world deserves something better than
      that.</p>

      <h1>But they cover more places than you.</h1>

      <p>We’re only getting started. Over time we’ll catch up to them. But
      to get there, we could really use your help.<p>

      <h1>How can I help?</h1>

      <p>If you see something that’s incorrect, you can correct it yourself. We
      store everything in <a href="https://wikidata.org/">Wikidata</a>, and
      just like Wikipedia, that’s open for anyone to edit. Your changes won’t
      be updated on Peppercat instantly: that happens as part of a regular
      process where we check that updates look correct, but (as long as they’re
      sensible!) they should appear soon.</p>

      <p>If fixing something yourself seems a bit too scary or difficult, or it
      all goes horribly wrong somewhere, just let us know by twitter or email,
      and we’ll look into it ourselves.</p>

      <p>If you think we’ve left out an important position somewhere, let us
      know, and we’ll look into adding it. We frequently laugh at the CIA
      managing to leave the Prime Minister and Foreign Secretary out of its <a
      href="https://www.cia.gov/resources/government/united-kingdom/">UK
      list</a>, but we’ve probably done something just as silly somewhere.</p>

      <p>If you want to help us add a whole new country, the most useful thing
      you can find for us is a link to an official website where the list of
      Ministers gets maintained and updated — i.e. it always lists the
      <i>current</i> Ministers, not just those who were appointed at a
      particular time. Then we can check every night for changes, to make sure
      our list is always up to date.</p>

      <h1 id="Licensing">How can I use this data?</h1>

      <p>At the bottom of each page of data, there’s a CSV file of what you can
      see on the page. We hope it should be fairly self-explanatory, but if
      it’s not, then get in touch. (NB: We haven’t completely worked out yet
      exactly what should be there, so you should beware that the columns might
      change in later versions.)</p>

      <p>The data is published under a <a
        href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/">Creative Commons
        Attribution NonCommercial 4.0 License</a>. If you want to use it in
        a way that isn’t covered by that, please contact us.
      </p>

      <h1>Who are you?</h1>

      <p>This was put together by Tony Bowden and Paul Youlten, but we’re
      building on the work of many, many others, particularly everyone who
      tirelessly contributes political information to Wikidata. But we’re also
      interested in who <i>you</i> are, how you’re using the data, or what we
      need to add next for you to be able to use it.</p>

      <h1 id="Contact">How can I get in touch?</h1>
