      <h1>What is this?</h1>

      <p>Lists of government ministers, and other key political leaders, from
      all over the world.</p>

      <h1>Why?</h1>

      <p>This sort of data is really important and useful in lots of scenarios,
      but is often surprisingly difficult to find. The CIA World Leaders list
      does the same sort of thing, but it has many problems, not least that it
      is usually very out of date (sometimes by years). Most other similar
      sources are less comprehensive, only publish very infrequently, or are
      only plain lists of names.</p>

      <h1>How often is the data updated?</h1>

      <p>Pretty much every day. I can't promise that everything is always
      completely up-to-date everywhere, but if something is out of date for
      more than a week, it's likely that I've missed an announcement somewhere,
      so please let me know.</p>

      <p>A summary of updates each week is available via the
      <a href="https://shuffled.beehiiv.com/">Shuffled</a> newsletter.</p>

      <h1>Where do you get the information from?</h1>

      <p>Most data comes from official government websites, or from news
      articles about new governments, cabinet reshuffles, etc. Wikipedia and
      Wikidata are also very helpful signals of changes, as in many countries
      these are updated quicker than official sources.</p>

      <h1>Can I reuse this data?</h1>

      <p>The Leaders data can be re-used under a <a
      href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/">Creative Commons
      Attribution NonCommercial 4.0 License</a>. Commercial use is
      prohibited without separate licensing.</p>

      <p>Note: the information visible on this website is a small part of a much
      larger dataset that also includes up-to-date membership data for 486
      legislative bodies, cleaned, sourced, and cross-referenced, as well as
      historic data, and additional biographic information, including names in
      multiple scripts and languages.</p>

      <p>Please get in touch to discuss rates for internal commercial use or
      for embedding in products or datasets for resale.</p>

      <h1>Who are you?</h1>

      <p>The data is primarily curated and maintained by Tony Bowden, building on work
      I started when creating <a href="https://everypolitician.org/">EveryPolitician</a>.
      Paul Youlten, Friedrich Lindenberg, Niamh Doyle, and Sean O'Connor have all provided a
      lot of assistance. The logo was created by <a href="https://twitter.com/wearewhy">Why</a>.</p>

      <p>But this also builds on the work of many, many others: particularly
      everyone who has contributed political information to Wikipedia or Wikidata,
      or has worked on all the wonderful Free Software this relies so heavily on. A
      lot of heavy lifting is made <b>much</b> simpler thanks to
      <a href="https://github.com/maxlath/wikibase-cli">wikibase-cli</a>,
      <a href="https://github.com/spencermountain/wtf_wikipedia">wtf_wikipedia</a>,
      <a href="https://stedolan.github.io/jq/">jq</a>, and
      <a href="https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv">qsv</a> (<i>n√©e</i>
      <a href="https://github.com/BurntSushi/xsv">xsv</a>).
