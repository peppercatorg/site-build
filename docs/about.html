      <h1>What is this?</h1>

      <p>Lists of all the government ministers, and other key political
      leaders, from all over the world.</p>

      <h1>Why?</h1>

      <p>This sort of data is really important and useful in lots of scenarios,
      but is often surprisingly difficult to find.  Until recently the default
      place to look was the CIA World Leaders list but, shortly after I <a
      href="https://www.opensanctions.org/articles/2022-01-18-peppercat/">wrote
      about how bad that was</a>, they made that post obsolete, by, erm, shutting
      down that site entirely. There are some other places that collate and
      publish similar data, but that often comes with a significant delay, and is
      almost always just plain lists of names.</p>

      <h1>How are you better than that?</h1>

      <p>At a very basic level, the data here includes some extra biographical
      information where possible (gender, data of birth, etc), but — much more
      importantly — everyone is also linked to a
      <a href="https://www.wikidata.org/">Wikidata</a> item. Not only does that
      unlock much more information about people, but it also means the
      <a href="https://query.wikidata.org/">Query Service</a> can be used to
      slice and dice all that data in elaborate ways that go far beyond the
      simple CSVs provided here.

      <h1>How often is the data updated?</h1>

      Pretty much every day. I can't promise that everything is always
      completely up-to-date everywhere, but if something is out of date for more
      than a few days, it's likely that I've missed an announcement somewhere,
      so please do let me know.

      <h1 id="Help">Can I help more directly?</h1>

      <p>Yes, please! Like its better-known sibling, Wikipedia, Wikidata can be
      edited by anyone, and for over a dozen countries (and rising) this data
      is already kept-up-to date by other people there.  No long-term
      committment is needed: checking from time to time that everything looks
      right for a country you know about, and fixing any problems, or adding
      more information about their politicians, is always hugely helpful.

      <p>But if fixing something yourself seems a bit too scary or difficult,
      or it all goes horribly wrong somewhere, just let me know by twitter or
      email, and I’ll see what I can do to help</p>

      <h1 id="Licensing">How can I use this data?</h1>

      <p>At the bottom of each page of data, there’s a CSV file of everything
      you can see on the page. Hopefully it should be fairly self-explanatory,
      but if it’s not, then get in touch. (NB: I haven’t completely worked out
      yet exactly what should be there, so you should beware that the columns
      might change in later versions.)</p>

      <p>This selection and arrangement of data is published under a <a
        href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/">Creative Commons
        Attribution NonCommercial 4.0 License</a>.
      </p>

      <p>API access to the data is also available through <a
      href="https://www.opensanctions.org/">OpenSanctions</a>.

      <h1>Who are you?</h1>

      <p>This was put together primarily by
      <a href="https://twitter.com/tmtm">Tony Bowden</a>, with a lot of assistance
      from <a href="https://twitter.com/payo">Paul Youlten</a> and <a
      href="https://twitter.com/pudo">Friedrich Lindenberg</a>, and designs
      from <a href="https://twitter.com/wearewhy">Why</a>. But it also builds
      on the work of many, many others, particularly everyone who has
      contributed political information to Wikidata, or has worked on all the
      wonderful Free Software this relies so heavily on. A lot of heavy lifting
      is made <b>much</b> simpler thanks to
      <a href="https://github.com/maxlath/wikibase-cli">wikibase-cli</a>,
      <a href="https://stedolan.github.io/jq/">jq</a>, and
      <a href="https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv">qsv</a> (<i>née</i>
      <a href="https://github.com/BurntSushi/xsv">xsv</a>).
